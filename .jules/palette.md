## 2025-05-24 - Skip Link for Landing Page
**Learning:** Adding a "Skip to content" link is a high-impact, low-effort accessibility win that significantly improves keyboard navigation. Using `transform: translateY` instead of `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` allows the link to be focusable and animate into view smoothly.
**Action:** Always verify keyboard accessibility on landing pages by tabbing through the interface. Ensure skip links are the first focusable element.
