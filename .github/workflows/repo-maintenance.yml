            Perform weekly repository maintenance:

            1. Check for outdated dependencies in pyproject.toml
            2. Review open issues older than 90 days
            4. Check for TODO comments in recent commits
            5. Verify README.md examples still work
            6. Verify CONTRIBUTING.md documentation accurately reflect the source code

            Create a single issue summarizing any findings.
            If critical security issues are found, also comment on open PRs.
